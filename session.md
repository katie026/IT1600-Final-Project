![image][image1]
-  coordinates  exchange of data between devices
- synchronizes data between the devices
- often considered the "glue" that holds the other layers of the OSI model together
    - coordinates activities of other layers and ensures the data is exchanged correctly
-  supports multiple types of connections that can be created dynamically and run over individual networks
